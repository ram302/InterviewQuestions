# InterviewQuestions
A few interview questions I've been asked in assessments. The answers I've submitted were resolved in the following methods.
- **FindMinPositive(int [] inArray)** - Find smallest positive integer not existing in array. E.g., [-1,-4,-6] would return 1, [-1,1,2,3] would return 4.
- **ReverseString(string inString)** - Simple task of return string reversal.
- **PerfectBinaryStringWithMinimumBitFlips()** - Simple class with method to determine minimum bit flips it would take to make a given binary string alternate.
